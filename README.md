# SOEN-390-Project

## Project Overview
CU Explorer is a cross-platform mobile navigation application developed for the SOEN 390 course (Winter 2025) at Concordia University. Designed to ease navigation across campus buildings, it features real-time geolocation, dynamic routing, and seamless integration with Google Calendar for class schedules. Additionally, the app provides custom indoor navigation overlays using Mappedin.

The CU Explorer app is designed to enhance the student experience by ensuring quick, easy access to key locations, such as lecture halls, libraries, and other important university facilities.

## Features
- **Real-time Geolocation:** Continuously track your location on Concordia University campuses.
- **Multi-Campus Support:** Navigate across multiple campuses (e.g., Sir George Williams, Loyola).
- **Dynamic Route Guidance:** Step-by-step directions from your current location to your destination.
- **Class Scheduling Integration:** Sync with Google Calendar to guide you to your next class.
- **Custom Building Overlays & Indoor Navigation:** Detailed indoor maps with overlays for improved navigation.
